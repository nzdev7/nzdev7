👋 **Hi**, I'm **Muhammad Nawaz**, a **self-taught Frontend Developer** from Pakistan building modern web applications. No CS degree — just real projects, real code, and real solutions. I started with HTML and worked my way up to building full-stack **MERN applications** that are fast, functional, and well-crafted.

🛠️ My work is built around three priorities: **clean code**, **fast performance**, and **great user experience**. I work across the full stack — frontend with **HTML5 · CSS3 · JavaScript (ES6+) · React.js · Next.js · Tailwind CSS**, backend with **Node.js · Express.js · MongoDB · REST APIs**, and tools like **Git · GitHub · Figma · Photoshop · VS Code** · and more.

🚀 What I build: **responsive mobile-first websites**, **React apps** with clean component architecture, **Next.js apps** with server-side rendering, and complete **full-stack MERN projects**.

📖 I started my web development journey in **2021**, and created my first website in **2022** — focusing on learning the fundamentals before sharing my work publicly. I'm currently publishing projects on GitHub, building full-stack MERN applications, and leveling up in **TypeScript** and **advanced React patterns**.

🟢 **Open to Work** — Frontend, React, or Junior Full Stack Developer roles. Full-time · Part-time · Remote · On-site.
